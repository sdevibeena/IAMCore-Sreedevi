# IAMCore-Sreedevi
The Project Identity Access Management system is done to develop an application to manage/access the information of users in a database. This application renders a platform for the user to perform several functions on the data stored in the database and also allows retrieving the data from it.  The term “Admin” is used as “the person who will manage the information” and the term “Identity” is used to denote the “information of user in the system”.    

This application has a Desktop GUI with two windows: 

Login

Main Menu

A user can Create, Update Delete and Search Identities using this application. A table displays all the updates results after each operation.

For a detailed description, a User Guide has been provided in the documents folder of the project.
